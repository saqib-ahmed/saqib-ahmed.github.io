I've been thinking about starting a blog for quite some time now. I wouldn't say I didn't find enough time to do it. It was more of a hesitation about what can I write; is there anything that can interest readers? I'm not still over this reluctance, but I'm gonna give it a try anyway. After all, it doesn't matter. Right? 

I'm gonna write some random stuff here about my personal and professional experiences. After every breakthrough in my professional life (no matter how small it was), I always felt an urge to write about it. Now I have a platform to do it, so here come my ramblings.

PS: My inspiration for starting a blog is this [blog post by Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/). I hope I can keep up with continuous haymaking and continuous jabbing.
