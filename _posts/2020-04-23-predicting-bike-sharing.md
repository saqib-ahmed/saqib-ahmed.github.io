This post complements the [previous post](https://saqib-ahmed.com/basic-neural-network) by demonstrating a real-world solution of a problem using the neural network defined in that post. This is a solution of [Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree's](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch) first project. Most of the text in this notebook is also borrowed from the same project. We'll be using the sample neural network we created in the previous post to predict daily bike rental ridership. We didn't use any DL framework (Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc) just to demonstrate the ideas behind the basic concepts in neural networks. The neural network implementation in this kernel elaborates the concepts like backward propagation, stochastic gradient descent, and hyperparameters. 

You can find this post as a Jupyter Notebook on [Github](https://github.com/DevUnleash/Predicting-Bike-Sharing/blob/master/Predicting%20Bike%20Sharing.ipynb) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saqibahmed515/predicting-bike-sharing). Feel free to submit a pull request if you want to change/improve anything.


## The dataset

We’re going to take on a forecasting problem to illustrate the concepts of deep learning. In [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset), we have the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between the years 2011 and 2012 in the [Capital bike-share system](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) in Washington, DC with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. We have a lot of parameters in this data that can influence Bike-sharing. We’ll model and train a neural network to harness this information to forecast the hourly count of rental bikes for the future. 


## Notebook Config
```python
%matplotlib inline
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Load and prepare the data

A critical step in working with neural networks is preparing the data correctly. Variables on different scales make it difficult for the network to efficiently learn the correct weights. Below, we've written the code to load and prepare the data.


```python
data_path = '../input/bike-sharing-dataset/hour.csv'

rides = pd.read_csv(data_path)
```


```python
rides.head()
```

## Checking out the data

This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the `cnt` column. You can see the first few rows of the data above.

Below is a plot showing the number of bike riders over the first 10 days or so in the data set. (Some days don't have exactly 24 entries in the data set, so it's not exactly 10 days.) You can see the hourly rentals here. This data is pretty complicated! The weekends have lower overall ridership and there are spikes when people are biking to and from work during the week. Looking at the data above, we also have information about temperature, humidity, and wind-speed, all of these parameters likely affecting the number of riders. We'll be trying to capture all this with our model.


```python
rides[:24*10].plot(x='dteday', y='cnt')
```

### Dummy variables
Here we have some categorical variables like the season, weather, month, etc. To include these in our model, we'll need to make binary dummy variables. This is simple to do with Pandas; thanks to `get_dummies()`.


```python
dummy_fields = ['season', 'weathersit', 'mnth', 'hr', 'weekday']
for each in dummy_fields:
    dummies = pd.get_dummies(rides[each], prefix=each, drop_first=False)
    rides = pd.concat([rides, dummies], axis=1)

fields_to_drop = ['instant', 'dteday', 'season', 'weathersit', 
                  'weekday', 'atemp', 'mnth', 'workingday', 'hr']
data = rides.drop(fields_to_drop, axis=1)
data.head()
```

### Scaling target variables
To make training the network easier, we'll standardize each of the continuous variables. That is, we'll shift and scale the variables such that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1.

The scaling factors are saved so we can go backward when we use the network for predictions.


```python
quant_features = ['casual', 'registered', 'cnt', 'temp', 'hum', 'windspeed']
# Store scalings in a dictionary so we can convert back later
scaled_features = {}
for each in quant_features:
    mean, std = data[each].mean(), data[each].std()
    scaled_features[each] = [mean, std]
    data.loc[:, each] = (data[each] - mean)/std
```

### Splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets

We'll save the data for approximately the last 21 days to use as a test set after we've trained the network. We'll use this set to make predictions and compare them with the actual number of riders.


```python
# Save data for approximately the last 21 days 
test_data = data[-21*24:]

# Now remove the test data from the data set 
data = data[:-21*24]

# Separate the data into features and targets
target_fields = ['cnt', 'casual', 'registered']
features, targets = data.drop(target_fields, axis=1), data[target_fields]
test_features, test_targets = test_data.drop(target_fields, axis=1), test_data[target_fields]
```

We'll split the data into two sets, one for training and one for validating as the network is being trained. Since this is time-series data, we'll train on historical data, then try to predict future data (the validation set).


```python
# Hold out the last 60 days or so of the remaining data as a validation set
train_features, train_targets = features[:-60*24], targets[:-60*24]
val_features, val_targets = features[-60*24:], targets[-60*24:]
```

## Time to build the network

This is the same neural network we created in the [previous post](https://saqib-ahmed.com/basic-neural-network). You can refer to that post to understand the details of how this network has been implemented. I'm adding it here for the sake of completeness.

```python

        # Set number of nodes in input, hidden and output layers.
        self.input_nodes = input_nodes
        self.hidden_nodes = hidden_nodes
        self.output_nodes = output_nodes

## Training the network

The strategy here is to find hyperparameters such that the error on the training set is low, while we're not overfitting to the data. If we train the network too long or have too many hidden nodes, it can become overly specific to the training set and will fail to generalize to the validation set (**overfitting**). That is, the loss in the validation set will start increasing as the training set loss drops.

We've also been using a method known as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to train the network. The idea is that for each training pass, you grab a random sample of the data instead of using the whole data set. You use many more training passes than with normal gradient descent, but each pass is much faster. This ends up training the network more efficiently.

### The number of iterations
This is the number of batches of samples from the training data we'll use to train the network. The more iterations we use, the better the model will fit the data. However, this process can have sharply diminishing returns and can waste computational resources if we use too many iterations. We want to find a number here where the network has a low training loss, and the validation loss is at a minimum. The ideal number of iterations would be a level that stops shortly after the validation loss is no longer decreasing.

### The learning rate
This scales the size of weight updates. If this is too big, the weights tend to explode and the network fails to fit the data. Normally a good choice to start at is 0.1; however, if we effectively divide the learning rate by `n_records`, we can have a bigger learning rate. In either case, if the network has problems fitting the data, reducing the learning rate can effect it positively. Note that the lower the learning rate, the smaller the steps are in the weight updates and the longer it takes for the neural network to converge. It's always a tradeoff between the **exploding gradient** and **longer computational times**. 

### The number of hidden nodes
In a model where all the weights are optimized, the more hidden nodes we have, the more accurate the predictions of the model will be. A fully optimized model could have weights of zero, after all. However, the more hidden nodes we have, the harder it will be to optimize the weights of the model, and the more likely it will be that suboptimal weights will lead to overfitting. With overfitting, the model will memorize the training data instead of learning the true pattern, and won't generalize well to unseen data.  

We can look at the losses dictionary for a metric of the network performance. If the number of hidden units is too low, then the model won't have enough space to learn and if it is too high there are too many options for the direction that the learning can take. The trick here is to find the right balance in the number of hidden units we choose.  We'll generally find that the best number of hidden nodes to use ends up being between the number of input and output nodes.

I have chosen the following hyperparameters. Feel free to play with these parameters by forking [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/saqibahmed515/predicting-bike-sharing). 
```python
iterations = 3500
learning_rate = 0.7
hidden_nodes = 15
output_nodes = 1
```

```python
import sys

N_i = train_features.shape[1]
network = NeuralNetwork(N_i, hidden_nodes, output_nodes, learning_rate)

losses = {'train':[], 'validation':[]}
for ii in range(iterations):
    # Go through a random batch of 128 records from the training data set
    batch = np.random.choice(train_features.index, size=128)
    X, y = train_features.iloc[batch].values, train_targets.iloc[batch]['cnt']
                             
    network.train(X, y)
    
    # Printing out the training progress
    train_loss = MSE(network.run(train_features).T, train_targets['cnt'].values)
    val_loss = MSE(network.run(val_features).T, val_targets['cnt'].values)
    sys.stdout.write("\rProgress: {:2.1f}".format(100 * ii/float(iterations)) \
                     + "% ... Training loss: " + str(train_loss)[:5] \
                     + " ... Validation loss: " + str(val_loss)[:5])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    
    losses['train'].append(train_loss)
    losses['validation'].append(val_loss)
```

    Progress: 100.0% ... Training loss: 0.058 ... Validation loss: 0.129


```python
plt.plot(losses['train'], label='Training loss')
plt.plot(losses['validation'], label='Validation loss')
plt.legend()
_ = plt.ylim()
```

## Check out the predictions

We're using the test data to view how well our network is modeling the data.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,4))

mean, std = scaled_features['cnt']
predictions = network.run(test_features).T*std + mean
ax.plot(predictions[0], label='Prediction')
ax.plot((test_targets['cnt']*std + mean).values, label='Data')
ax.set_xlim(right=len(predictions))
ax.legend()

dates = pd.to_datetime(rides.iloc[test_data.index]['dteday'])
dates = dates.apply(lambda d: d.strftime('%b %d'))
ax.set_xticks(np.arange(len(dates))[12::24])
_ = ax.set_xticklabels(dates[12::24], rotation=45)
```

## Conclusion
We can see the prediction accuracy of even this simple neural network and appreciate the heuristics of a machine. The simple mathematical model explained in the [previous post](https://saqib-ahmed.com/basic-neural-network) solves a seemingly complex forecasting problem. 

The predictions are pretty good until 22nd December. After that, you can see the predictions don't coincide with the actual data at that time. This can be due to the fact that from 22nd December till new year eve, we have the holiday season which can impact the bike ridership. The model couldn't learn this holiday behavior because it didn't have enough training data to fit for the holiday season. Had the data been for more than 5 years, the model might have fitted the holiday times accurately as well.
